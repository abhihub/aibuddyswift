# buddyChatGPT Setup Guide

## Quick Start

1. **Get your OpenAI API Key**
   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

2. **Choose Your Method**

### Method A: Direct Swift Execution (EASIEST)
```bash
# Edit the API key in buddyChatGPT_Simple.swift first
swift buddyChatGPT_Simple.swift
```
This runs the app immediately without Xcode!

### Method B: Manual Xcode Project (RECOMMENDED)
See `XCODE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for step-by-step instructions to create a new Xcode project and copy our files.

### Method C: Try Generated Project
   ```bash
   # Open the project in Xcode
   open buddyChatGPT.xcodeproj
   
   # In Xcode:
   # 1. Select buddyChatGPT target
   # 2. Go to Info tab
   # 3. Add custom property: OPENAI_API_KEY = your_api_key_here
   # 4. Build and run (âŒ˜R)
   ```
   
   **If Xcode shows project file errors:**
   ```bash
   # Use the fixed project generator
   ./fix_project.sh
   # Then open the new project
   open buddyChatGPT.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **For Distribution**
   ```bash
   # Build distribution version
   ./build.sh
   
   # Install on any Mac
   cd dist
   ./install.sh
   ```
